			<p>Hello world! The first necessary post in a tech blog!
My name is Konstantinos, I&rsquo;m a junior-ish system administrator, currently working in a devops role. My pursuit is to get a better understanding of Linux, networking, all the apps that are used in the space that make our lives easier plus everything else that seems interesting to me!</p>
<p>The idea behind this blog (subject to change though) is to have posts of varying difficulty, ranging from easy and everyday stuff, basic operations to make our life simpler, to medium where we will delve in setting up applications and harder to bring multiple systems together with technologies such as containers etc. After all that, i&rsquo;ll try to bring most of these concepts together with automation and testing to make them even more effective and stable. Down the road I&rsquo;m thinking of accompanying the posts with examples and videos when possible plus the code and try adding discussions to solve possible problems or improve the posts.</p>
<p>Hope to see you around!</p>
